-- Migration: Drop NBA tables (games, injury_data, player_statistics)
-- This migration drops the core tables for the NBA data warehouse
-- Tables are dropped in reverse order to respect foreign key constraints

-- Drop player_statistics first (has foreign key to games)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS player_statistics CASCADE;

-- Drop injury_data
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS injury_data CASCADE;

-- Drop games last (referenced by player_statistics)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS games CASCADE;
